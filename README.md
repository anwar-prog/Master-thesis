    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p align="justify">
      Impulse radio communication relies on short, high-energy bursts of signals, but these signals often get distorted or lost due to noise and interference. 
      Traditional signal processing methods struggle to handle these challenges efficiently. While research suggests that AI (deep learning) can improve signal processing, 
      most approaches haven't been tested in real-world applications.
      <br><br>
      This thesis explores deep learning techniques that can clean, enhance, and process impulse radio signals more effectively than traditional methods. 
      <b>The goal is to identify the best AI approaches</b> and apply them to make impulse radio receivers more accurate and reliable.

## Proposed Solution: Hybrid AI-Traditional Signal Processing  

### Why This Solution?  
Impulse radio signals are often corrupted by noise and interference, reducing their quality.  

✔️ Traditional methods like Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Wavelet Transform are efficient but struggle in complex environments.  
✔️ Deep learning models excel at pattern recognition but can be computationally expensive.  


## A Hybrid AI-Traditional Signal Processing Approach

A hybrid approach combines both to provide:

✅ **Efficiency of traditional signal processing** (for quick filtering & preprocessing).  
✅ **Adaptability of AI** (for noise reduction, feature extraction, and signal classification).
